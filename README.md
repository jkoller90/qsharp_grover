Outline of project contents:

In root (./) you will see a simple operation using a Hadamard gate in Operation.qs with OperationHost.py as the running script. You will also see a basic template for how this API works. See base_operation.md for explanation. 

In /quantum operation/ you will find a similar base structure with Bell states being explored. See bell_state_operation.md for explanation.

In /grover/ is our Grover search! Explanation included in the MD file.
